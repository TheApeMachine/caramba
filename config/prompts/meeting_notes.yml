    You are analyzing a conversation transcript to extract meeting notes.

    Please provide a structured meeting report in Markdown format.

    Your report should include:

    1. **Meeting Summary**: A concise overview of what was discussed.
    2. **Key Ideas & Consensus**:
       - List the main ideas/topics discussed.
       - For each idea, clearly state the level of consensus (Strong Consensus, Partial Consensus, Disagreement, or Unclear).
       - Summarize the arguments for/against.
       - Mention key participants involved in that specific discussion.
    3. **Action Items / Next Steps**: If any follow-up actions were mentioned or implied.

    Format the output cleanly using Markdown headers (#, ##, ###), bullet points, and bold text for readability.

    IMPORTANT: Ignore all tool calls and tool results (code execution, file reads, etc.) in the transcript. Focus ONLY on the conversation between the participants.
