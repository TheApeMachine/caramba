Accumulator is a wrapper for a provider Event stream which has both
a direct throughput, and an accumulating buffer. This allows you to
take advantage of both real-time feedback flow, like output to a
user, or frontend of some kind, while also being able to use the
full output once the provider model is finished generating a response.
