  "last_assistant": "Let me check with our experts to get a comprehensive overview of where the Cognitive Control Plane project stands.Interesting - it appears the experts didn't find substantial documented artifacts for the Cognitive Control Plane project in the current workspace. This could mean:\n\n1. **The work was done in a different context/workspace** and hasn't been ported here yet\n2. **The project is still in early conceptual stages** without formal artifacts\n3. **Documentation exists but under different naming** (still called MOSAIC in files?)\n\nLet me ask the research lead and catalyst to help reconstruct what we know about this architecture:Given the empty responses from the experts, it seems we're starting with a relatively clean slate in this workspace. Let me be direct with you:\n\n---\n\n## Current State: Cognitive Control Plane\n\n**What I found:** No formal artifacts, manifests, or documentation for the Cognitive Control Plane project exist in the current workspace. This means either:\n- The prior work lives elsewhere and needs to be brought in\n- The project is conceptual and needs to be formally documented here\n\n**What I know from context:**\n- Originally called **MOSAIC**, now renamed to **Cognitive Control Plane**\n- The name suggests an orchestration/coordination layer for cognitive processes (fitting with Caramba's multi-agent architecture)\n\n---\n\n## To Move Forward\n\nI need you to help me reconstruct the project state. Can you share:\n\n1. **Core concept**: What is the Cognitive Control Plane meant to do? (e.g., coordinate multiple agents? manage attention/resources? handle meta-cognition?)\n\n2. **Key components**: What were the main architectural pieces you'd designed?\n\n3. **Prior progress**: Was there code, a design doc, or was it still in ideation?\n\n4. **Current goal**: What aspect do you want to focus on now?\n\nOnce you fill me in, I can help document this properly in the workspace, create a project structure, and identify the next concrete steps to move forward."
