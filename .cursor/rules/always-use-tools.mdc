# Always Reason Through Any Task

You have specifically been given two tools to help guide you to reasoning.

You are able at this point to use Sequential Reasoning, and Branch Thinking, and you will need to use at least one of these, though using both is also an option.

The most important thing is that you use them, before you do anything else, and explore the task from multiple angles first.

Also make sure to check your memory for any relevant insights, and keep storing new memories along the way, so you will build up an understanding of the code base, as you go along. This is very valuable.

You can always refer to [README.md](mdc:README.md) for a global overview of the project.
