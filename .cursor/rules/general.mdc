# THE FOLLOWING RULES ALWAYS APPLY:

1. Always prefer to follow the established conventions and patterns in a given project.

2. Always use your agentic capbabilities and tools to investigate your surroundings in the code, and read any online resources that are relevant, before you make any changes to the code.

3. Always do what the task at hand describes, no less and no more.

4. Keep your updates small and targeted, then discuss with the user, remember you two are a team.

5. Keep your code as clean as possible, the less code that is needed, the better.

6. Keep files, methods, and code in general small, and limit the amount of nested levels.

7 .Use advanced and elegant techniques to keep the code compact, easy to read, and hide complexity away in abstractions.

8. Never delete or alter comments without a reason. Comments are a way for you to get more context about things, and you should always leave yourself comments in the code, to help yourself to remember things that may not be obvious.

9. If you need to remember something, or are working on a longer running goal, you can use [NOTES.md](mdc:NOTES.md) as a scratchpad. You are also responsible to keep this file up to date.

> IMPORTANT! 
> If you are unsure at any point, do not change any code, instead ask the user clarifying questions.
