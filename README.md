# 🌈 caramba

**A substrate for A.I. research.**

**Caramba** is a comprehensive machine learning research stack built to guide you through the entire lifecycle of A.I. development. Whether you want to rapidly prototype a new concept or dive deep into low-level hardware optimization, Caramba provides a dedicated environment tailored to your exact workflow. 

Operating on the core philosophy that **a manifest is a model**, Caramba allows you to define complex architectures entirely via YAML files instead of writing code. It acts as a complete laboratory, seamlessly taking you from your initial idea to a heavily optimized, fully profiled pipeline.

**Core Capabilities:**

* 📝 **Fully Manifest-Driven:** Declare your topology in simple YAML. Caramba goes far beyond standard layers and operations, allowing you to easily express sophisticated, non-standard mathematical primitives and advanced custom architectures.
* 🚀 **Flexibility & Optimization:** Dedicated to high performance, Caramba gives you the tools to choose your level of abstraction. Move fast to iterate on high-level ideas, or drop down for granular, low-level control over compute and memory.
* 🔬 **Sophisticated Inspection:** Deeply understand your network's behavior. Caramba is equipped with advanced inspection and profiling tooling, bringing clarity to every step of the end-to-end research process.
* 🤖 **Integrated A.I. Collaboration:** Supercharge your workflow with a built-in A.I. assistant and virtual research team. Caramba is built from the ground up to support both human team collaboration and agentic brainstorming.
* 🔐 **Zero-Compromise Privacy:** Working with proprietary or sensitive data? Caramba can operate entirely in an optional "local-only" mode, ensuring your research and intellectual property never leave your secure environment.

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
go install github.com/theapemachine/caramba@latest

caramba serve
```

The above command brings up just the HTTP API, which means you still have to bring up the data stores yourself.

Alternatively you could grab the `docker-compose.yml` from this repository to make this process much easier.

`caramba research <name>` lays out a project as a directory under version control:

```
research/project/my-ablation-study/
├── manifest/
│   ├── architecture/   # the architectures under comparison
│   └── operation/      # custom operations specific to this study
└── paper/              # write-up
```

Configuration lives in [cmd/asset/config.yml](cmd/asset/config.yml) and is loaded through [pkg/config](pkg/config). The resolver tries `--config`, then `./cmd/asset/config.yml`, `./config.yml`, `$HOME/.caramba/config.yml`, and finally the binary's embedded default.

## Building for a specific backend

```bash
# CPU — Go + AVX2/SSE2/NEON. Always available.
go build ./pkg/backend/compute/cpu/...

# CUDA — Linux, NVIDIA CUDA toolkit
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -tags "cgo cuda" ./pkg/backend/device/cuda/...

# Metal — macOS, Xcode command-line tools (darwin + cgo selects Metal automatically)
go generate ./pkg/backend/device/metal
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -tags cgo ./pkg/backend/device/metal/...

# XLA via PJRT — configure compute.xla in cmd/asset/config.yml first
go build -tags "cgo xla" ./pkg/backend/device/xla/...
```

The Metal backend embeds `pkg/backend/device/metal/kernels.metallib`
from `pkg/backend/device/metal/*.metal`. Dense elementwise binary and
unary kernels cover `float32`, `float16`, and `bfloat16`, including
extended unary math and activation kernels for `rsqrt`, `exp`, `log`,
`sin`, `cos`, `tanh`, `sigmoid`, `silu`, `swish`, `softsign`, `elu`,
`selu`, `leaky_relu`, `hardsigmoid`, and `hardswish`; Metal shape
kernels cover concat/split/head reshape/last-token/transpose/upsample
movement across the same storage dtypes with dtype-specific shader
entry points and `uint4` movement for aligned contiguous ranges.
Metal matmul kernels cover `matmul` and fused `matmul_add` for the
same storage dtypes with tiled threadgroup execution. Metal projection
and model kernels cover `linear`, `fused_qkv`, `lora_merge`, and
`lora_apply` for the same storage dtypes; the LoRA apply path stages
the rank-space intermediate in device scratch storage and submits the
two GPU stages in one command buffer. Metal transformer support covers
`embedding_lookup`, `embedding_bag`, `apply_mask`, `causal_mask`, and
`alibi_bias` for the same storage dtypes; embedding kernels report
invalid index data through the asynchronous command completion path.
Metal vision kernels cover `conv1d`, `conv2d`, `conv3d`,
`conv_transpose2d`, `max_pool2d`, `avg_pool2d`,
`adaptive_avg_pool2d`, and `adaptive_max_pool2d` for the same storage
dtypes using NCL/NCHW/NCDHW memory layout and GPU-side accumulation.
Metal softmax covers the same storage dtypes with one threadgroup per
row, parallel max reduction, parallel sum reduction, and normalized
dtype-native writes. Metal normalization covers `layernorm` and
`rmsnorm` for the same storage dtypes with row-local parallel
reductions and dtype-native writes. These families run through the
device command queue with async completion, pooled `MTLBuffer`
storage, and per-kernel pipeline caching.

Every backend implements the same interface, and the optimizer does the same math everywhere:

```go
type Runner interface {
    Execute(
        ctx context.Context,
        graph *ir.Graph,
        targets []*ir.Node,
    ) (map[string]tensor.Tensor, error)

    Location() tensor.Location
    Close() error
}
```

Backend kernels upload values once into a resident tensor store and only download at real boundaries. The executor releases owned dependencies after their last graph consumer; the host arena reuses released spans. Host-staged dispatch is restricted to the host backend, so Metal, CUDA, and XLA paths cannot silently route through CPU slices.

## 🔬 Testing

Every code file has a `_test.go` mirror. Tests are GoConvey-style ("Given X, it should Y", nested). Backend kernels run parity tests against the scalar reference at `N ∈ {1, 7, 64, 1024, 8192}` with tight ULP bounds — the tolerance is a contract, not a knob.

```bash
go test ./...
CGO_ENABLED=1 go test -tags cgo            ./pkg/backend/device/metal/...
CGO_ENABLED=1 go test -tags "cgo cuda"     ./pkg/backend/device/cuda/...
              go test -tags "cgo xla"      ./pkg/backend/device/xla/...
```
