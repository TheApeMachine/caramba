Please proceed with the memory system optimizations. The document and the code in the document are to be considered as guidelines, and do not need to be the final implementation. It is very important to consider the best approach in context of the agent framework, and keep the developer experience in mind at all times. Also, we need to try and keep individual files as small as possible, and instead spread things out over specialized, individual types/objects, and use composition to construct more complex behavior. This does not just apply to the enhancements we're making now, but also to any code we have already written, and could benefit from further improvements. Also, be very careful not to start duplicating things, because you are not aware of existing implementations. Always make sure you are aware of your surroundings. And finally, keep best practices in mind, and write compact, lean, and efficient implementations, following modern best practices. No placeholders, and no simplified implementations either, we need the best features we are able to achieve :) Good luck!
