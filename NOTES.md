# CARAMBA Project Notes

## Team and Agent System Analysis

### Current Structure

1. Teams (`tools/team.go`)

   - ✅ Enhanced with team member management (internal)
   - ✅ Added team hierarchy support
   - ✅ Added team lead concept
   - ✅ Added concurrent access protection
   - ✅ Proper separation of coordinator and team lead responsibilities
   - ✅ Removed team members from JSON schema (coordinator only creates empty team with lead)
   - Still needs:
     - Team communication channels
     - Task distribution logic
     - Progress tracking

2. Agents (`tools/agent.go`)

   - ✅ Added role-based behavior
   - ✅ Added capability system
   - ✅ Added team integration
   - ✅ Added concurrent access protection
   - ✅ Added role-specific task handlers
   - Still needs:
     - Actual task execution logic
     - Communication protocols
     - State persistence
     - Learning mechanisms

3. Configuration (`cmd/cfg/config.yml`)
   - ✅ Has sophisticated prompt templates
   - ✅ Has well-defined role descriptions
   - Still needs:
     - Team structure configurations
     - Agent capability definitions
     - Communication settings
     - Task distribution rules

### Workflow Understanding

1. Team Creation Process

   - Coordinator creates a new team (empty except for configuration)
   - Coordinator assigns a team lead
   - Team lead is responsible for building the team
   - Team members are managed internally, not exposed in JSON schema

2. Role Responsibilities
   - Coordinator: Creates teams and assigns team leads
   - Team Lead: Manages team composition and task distribution
   - Expert: Handles specialized tasks within their domain
   - Verifier: Validates work and ensures quality

### Required Improvements

1. Team Management

   - ✅ Internal team member tracking
   - ✅ Methods for team lead to manage members
   - ✅ Team hierarchy support
   - Still needed:
     - Team communication channels
     - Task distribution system
     - Progress tracking
     - Team-wide state management

2. Agent Specialization

   - ✅ Role-based agent behaviors
   - ✅ Agent capabilities system
   - Still needed:
     - Actual task execution logic
     - Learning and adaptation
     - State persistence
     - Advanced communication

3. Team Coordination

   - Still needed:
     - Task distribution mechanisms
     - Workflow management
     - Progress tracking
     - Team-wide communication

4. System Integration
   - Still needed:
     - MARVIN architecture integration
     - Error handling and recovery
     - Monitoring and logging
     - System-wide communication

### Next Steps

1. Implement Task Management

   - Create task representation
   - Add task distribution logic
   - Implement task status tracking
   - Add task dependencies

2. Add Communication System

   - Design communication protocols
   - Implement message passing
   - Add event system
   - Create notification system

3. Enhance State Management

   - Add state persistence
   - Implement state recovery
   - Add state synchronization
   - Create backup mechanisms

4. Improve Error Handling
   - Add comprehensive error types
   - Implement recovery mechanisms
   - Add error reporting
   - Create fallback systems

### Progress Tracking

- [x] Enhance Team structure
- [x] Improve Agent implementation
- [x] Add team management functionality
- [x] Implement role-based behaviors
- [x] Proper separation of coordinator and team lead responsibilities
- [ ] Create team coordination system
- [ ] Add proper error handling
- [ ] Implement monitoring and logging
- [ ] Create communication protocols

### Recent Changes

1. Enhanced Team Structure:

   - Removed team members from JSON schema
   - Made team member management internal
   - Clarified coordinator vs team lead responsibilities
   - Added proper documentation for method usage
   - Fixed Name() method to return TeamName instead of Tool

2. Enhanced Agent Structure:
   - Added role-based behavior
   - Implemented capability system
   - Added team integration
   - Added role-specific task handlers
   - Added concurrent access protection

### Observations

1. The team and agent system now has clearer responsibility separation
2. Coordinator's role is simpler: create team and assign lead
3. Team lead has more responsibility: manage team composition and tasks
4. Internal team management is properly encapsulated
5. JSON schema only exposes what's needed for team creation
6. Still need to implement actual task execution logic
7. Communication system needs to be designed and implemented
8. State management needs to be enhanced
9. Error handling needs to be more comprehensive
