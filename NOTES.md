# Team Creation and Task Flow Documentation

## System Architecture Overview

The system implements a hierarchical structure for task management and execution, with several key components working together to handle complex workflows.

## Team Creation Process

1. **Coordinator Initialization**

   - The coordinator is created as an agent in the system Pool
   - Pool is a singleton managing all active agents
   - Each entity in the Pool contains:
     - Config
     - Generator
     - Toolset (including Team tool)

2. **Team Creation**

   - Coordinator analyzes task and identifies domains
   - Creates teams for each domain using the Team tool
   - Each team gets:
     - Unique name
     - System prompt
     - Programmatically assigned team lead

3. **Team Structure**
   - Teams implement tool-like behavior
   - Manage collections of agents with shared system prompts
   - Support both competition and collaboration modes
   - Team leads can create and manage experts

## Task Flow Process

1. **Task Breakdown (Coordinator Level)**

   - Coordinator reasons through the main task
   - Identifies key components
   - Maps dependencies between components
   - Categorizes components into domains
   - Creates appropriate teams

2. **Team Lead Operations**

   - Analyzes domain requirements
   - Decides on needed expert types
   - Creates experts with specific system prompts
   - Manages task delegation
   - Evaluates results
   - Ensures workload completion

3. **Expert Level**
   - Receives specific tasks from team lead
   - Works within their domain of expertise
   - Reports results back to team lead
   - Collaborates with other experts as needed

## Dependency Management

The system uses a ConsensusSpace to manage complex interactions:

- Tracks dependencies between agents
- Adjusts confidence based on method diversity
- Handles quantum uncertainty levels
- Manages waiting groups for dependent tasks
- Facilitates agent notifications when dependencies are met

## Key Features

1. **Hierarchical Structure**

   - Coordinator → Teams → Team Leads → Experts
   - Clear delegation paths
   - Managed dependencies

2. **Flexible Execution Modes**

   - Competition mode
   - Collaboration mode
   - Discussion mode

3. **Smart Task Management**
   - Dependency tracking
   - Method diversity consideration
   - Confidence adjustment
   - Quantum uncertainty handling

## Long-term Goals

1. Enhance the consensus mechanism for better team coordination
2. Implement more sophisticated task distribution algorithms
3. Improve dependency resolution efficiency
4. Expand the expert creation capabilities
5. Develop better metrics for team performance evaluation

## Observations

1. The system effectively separates concerns between different levels of hierarchy
2. Strong support for complex task dependencies
3. Flexible team structures allow for various working modes
4. Built-in mechanisms for quality control and task evaluation
5. Sophisticated consensus building for multi-agent tasks
